    A Instantiable (Inst) is a data container that is saved from one Python environment
    and can be instantiated into others.

    Each Inst:
    - Is defined by a spec and a path that are supplied at its creation.
    - The path indicating a folder in the local filesystem where the data for
      this persistable is stored.  (This path may also be the local caching
      for source contents that are stored in S3 or other locations.)
    - The spec can be
      - a dict, or
      - or the name of a loadable dict
    - In either case it is recursively expanded (see )
    - The expanded spec is saved in _spec_.json or _spec_.yaml in its folder.

    Persistable API
      .spec ................. Is the 'spec' dict for this inst
      .path ................. Returns the Path for this inst
      .name ................. Returns the name for this inst
      .version .............. Returns the version for this inst
      .load(path) ........... Universal loader for all Persistables
      .save([path]) ......... Saves persistable to disk (optionally sets its path)

    Utility Methods
      .get(Inst|dict, [key1, key2, ...])
      .get(Inst|dict, "dotted.key.path")
      .set(dict, [key1, key2, ...], value)
      .set(dict, "dotted.key.path", value)

    Notes
    -----

    Information access guideline for Inst subclasses:
    - Anything that is instantaneously accessible, and that doesn't require parameters
      from the user to obtain information, should be implemented as a property
    - Everything else should be accessed by a method with a "get_" prefix. In other
      words, if any of the following is true, it should be accessed by a method:
      - If the data access performs IO
      - If the data requires non-trivial compute
      - If the data should be a candidate for caching
      - If lazy loading is beneficial
